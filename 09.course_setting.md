## Putting control stands into the hard ground

The main goal in placing the controls in the terrain is that the competitors can ride by the control without stopping.

Many times the ground is too hard for the control stand to be placed in such position.
Possible strategies:

- Try to find a softer spot, but such that comeptitors can still ride by without stopping
- Use steel stake and hammer to make a hole in the ground, then place control stand in the hole
- Use rocks to create a small mound around the control stand which should hold it upright

The {bdg-success}`best` working strategy proved to be:
- Use **battery powered drill with 10mm masonry bit** to make a hole in the ground, 8-12cm deep
- Use standard hammer (not mallet) or a rock to hammer the control stand into the hole
- Use the same instrument to ram the ground around the control
This technique works even in the hardest ground including sandstone rock as shown in tests.


## SI units

![bs11bs](_static/img/bs11bs.png)

- We will be using BS11 units that are SI-Air only units with 1.5m range
- The unit is turned on and off *by magnet* by applying it to the side next to I/O symbol

```{admonition} Activating BS11 units
:class: caution

The units can not be activated by the competitors!  
It is very important that the unit is turned on by the setter using the special magnetic stick.
